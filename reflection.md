What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Just getting hands-on. Changing the text or background of stuff with JavaScript and seeing it
instantly update on the page really made it click.

How did you choose your milestone messages?
I just went with something basic since it took me more time and effort for me to change the 
visual effects.

What challenge or bug surprised you?
The visual effects were confusing for me. It took me a second to get my hexcodes and such right.

What personal twist did you add?
I turned it into a "Bratz Doll Cat Clicker," by using themed colors for the background, a lip emoji
for the button, and lipstick and painted nail emoji's for the ending buttons.

What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Idle clicker games like Cookie Clicker. Also, websites that tracks your progress or
changes things visually when you interact with them.
